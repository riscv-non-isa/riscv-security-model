== Introduction

Security needs to be an intrinsic part of the hardware, software, and firmware and no longer an afterthought or add-on feature. This document provides a holistic view of the threat model, security analysis, security requirements/ recommendations enabling anyone building a RISC-V platform.


=== Guiding Principles
==== Intrinsic Security

Security has often been a late consideration in the development of systems, hardware, and software. The emergence of exploits such as malware, trojans, the recent Spectre, Meltdown, RAMbleed attacks has resulted in serious financial and reputational losses. This illustrates the need to consider security as an essential component, directly built into a system rather than layered on top.

Unlike other commercial architectures such as X86 and ARM which carry a lot of legacies, RISC-V is a clean slate architecture that can invite a whole lot of new features and solutions both in hardware and software. Below are some key rationale for improving and accelerating RISC-V security

* Clean slate architecture with no legacy support complexity
* Open security model accelerates hardware security innovation
* Opportunity to incorporate industry learnings & best practices for security
* Open governance facilitates collaboration on the best security approach
* Royalty-free model enables wide access to new hardware security solutions thereby democratizing innovation.

==== Zero Trust Model

The Zero Trust model follows the principle "never trust, always verify." The term Zero Trust does not mean "Zero" Trust, but it's quite the opposite. It improves the trust of the whole platform by not having any implicit trust assumptions among various components that are interconnected, but by establishing trust verifying/ authenticating before trusting.

For further details please refer to <<zero_trust>>.


=== Device Model

This diagram below represents a generic device model having an application processor, other IPs, etc. on the left side and root-of-trust on the right side that is isolated from each other. The only communication between the two domains is via a security mailbox.

The root-of-trust consists of the following elements:

. An immutable code and data that are typically programmed into ROM/ OTP and root-keys either provisioned into OTP or generated every time from the PUF (physical unclonable function) hardware
. A mutable code and data that are updated onto the flash to fix bugs or enhance features, which are authenticated and verified before consumption
. A secure storage mechanism to store secrets/ assets bound to the platform, ex: root-key
. A secure mailbox is the only mechanism to communicate between both the domains


=== Security Goals

The security goals are high-level essential security features for a platform to implement, for the product to be secure and trustworthy. Note that depending on the final usecase, some or all of these goals may not be required and that this will be defined in the mapping to platform specifications (TBD - point to the mapping section later).
