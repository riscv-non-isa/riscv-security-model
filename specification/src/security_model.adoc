== Platform Security Model

In this chapter, we shall discuss the various components of the Zero Trust Platform Security Model along with guidance for architecting them effectively.

=== Platform Unique Identity

This is typically done by provisioning a Hardware Unique Key (HUK) or root-key into on-chip immutable storage such as One Time Programmable (OTP) memory/ fuses OR by using hardware or software Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) that can regenerate unique identities for a platform based on the device characteristics. Once a platform is uniquely identifiable, then that identity shall be verifiable and attested as proof of identity. DICE ^[12]^ attestation architecture from TCG for example uses hardware unique key to establish a cryptographically strong device identity, attest software and security policy, and assist in safely deploying and verifying software updates.



=== Platform Root-of-Trust

A hardware Root-of-Trust (RoT) is the foundation on which all security operations of a computing system depend. It contains the root keys used for cryptographic functions and enables a secure boot process. It is inherently trusted, and therefore must be secure by design. The most secure implementation of a root of trust utilizes hardware to make it immune from malware attacks. As such, it can be a stand-alone security module or implemented as a security module within a processor or System on Chip (SoC). The RoT consists of both an immutable firmware that is trusted which never changes on a production platform such as ROM and an updatable firmware that is verified every time before trusting that is anchored to the hardware. The RoT shall provide trusted services such as verified boot as a chain of trust, key provisioning, and management, security lifecycle management, sealed storage, device management, crypto services, attestation, etc. There are 2 types of RoT available to choose

* Hardware-based RoT are of two types - fixed-function and programmable, where the fixed-function RoT is specifically targeted for resource-constrained IoT product segments while the fully reprogrammable RoT is for all other product segments where a more complex set of security functions are required that can evolve over time to meet new attacks/ vulnerabilities.

Hardware RoTs can either be further classified into two types

  ** Integrated RoT, where RoT IP is integrated into an SoC
  ** Discrete RoT (platform RoT), where RoT is added to the platform/ PCB such as TPM module or secure elements chip

* Software-based RoT is specifically designed for IoT devices that are already shipped, where installing RoT software that could leverage existing hardware blocks such as cache memory for generating unique identity, while the rest of operations are performed in software.


=== Device Lifecycle

A security lifecycle defines the security state of a device through its lifetime, where each state of the device defines the security properties to be in effect in that state. The below security life cycle model is borrowed from OpenTitan’s life cycle model acts as a good reference for implementing product-specific security life cycle whether we use an integrated RoT or discrete RoT such as OpenTitan or TPM module or Secure Elements.

=== Firmware Version Anti-rollback

Anti-roll back mechanisms shall be implemented to prevent unauthorized firmware version rollback as described in chapter Firmware Upgrade. Typically this is done using monotonic counters in hardware.



=== Sealed Storage





=== Authorized Software Execution

Any software/ firmware before being executed the platform shall verify the authenticity with digital signature checks.



=== Trusted Execution Capability

A trusted execution environment (TEE) is a context of execution protected by a system processor with a Hardware-attested TCB. Sensitive secrets like cryptographic keys, authentication strings, or data with intellectual property and privacy concerns can be preserved within a TEE, and operations involving these secrets can be performed within the TEE, thereby mitigating against loss of confidentiality and integrity. A TEE also helps ensure that operations performed within it and the associated data cannot be viewed from outside, not even by privileged software or debuggers. Communication with the TEE is designed to only be possible through designated interfaces, and it is the responsibility of the TEE designer/ developer to define these interfaces appropriately.

* Memory Isolation with Encryption
* Application Isolation via TEEs
* VM Isolation with Encryption
* Integrity Protection using Merkle Trees



Multiple TEEs are becoming popular as gathering assets from various stakeholders in a single TEE could be limiting and risky from a business perspective ^[15]^ .

=== Confidential Computing

The Confidential Computing Consortium has defined confidential computing as “the protection of data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment”, and identified three primary attributes for what constitutes a Trusted Execution Environment: data integrity, data confidentiality, and code integrity. As described in https://confidentialcomputing.io/whitepaper-01-latest/[Confidential Computing: Hardware-Based Trusted Execution for Applications and Data], four additional attributes may be present (code confidentiality, programmability, recoverability, and attestability) but are not strictly necessary for a computational environment to be classified as confidential computing.

=== Side-channel Attack Resistance

Side-channel attacks (the most recent popular ones being Spectre & Meltdown) exploit unintended information leakage, such as the execution time of an algorithm depending on the secret key being processed. On embedded systems, common observations which leak side-channel information include timing and power (including electromagnetic emissions from power). These leaks are coupled to the physical design of the device, including microarchitectural design choices. Such attacks may require intimate physical measurements taken from the device or maybe possibly from external interfaces or even across networks. Microarchitectural covert channels exploit changes in execution timing resulting from competing for access to limited hardware resources such as caches, TLBs, branch predictors, and prefetchers. An example microarchitectural attack is: a Spy & Trojan process exploits the Victim process and leaks secrets, ex: the cache lines used by the Trojan create a footprint that can be sensed by the Spy and similarly, TLB, prefetchers also can be utilized for the sensing.

Measuring the “leakage” from a device to understand if the vulnerability is present is typically done with a statistical measurement showing if a device has differing characteristics when processing different secret values. In power and timing side-channels this commonly uses the Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA) method ^[17]^ which relies on Welch’s T-Test, which has been standardized as ISO 17825 ^[18]^ .

Countermeasures may include algorithmic-level and physical level changes, and the choice of countermeasure depends on required protection along with interoperability requirements. Modifying standard algorithms to include a mask means the algorithm processes a random value (unknown to the attacker), complicating side-channel attacks. For example, AES can be masked such that it produces the same input and output as the standard AES modes, but with different intermediate states than unmasked AES ^[19]^ . The encryption can also be adjusted to be used in a leakage-resistant fashion, which is incompatible with “standard” AES modes ^[20]^ . Physical changes such as dual-rail logic can suppress the leakage, and do not require changes to the algorithms ^[21]^ . As another example, the recent fence.T new ISA extension proposed for RISC-V for temporal partitioning prevents any interference between security domains, each such microarchitectural state must be reset to a state that is independent of execution history before a context switch to a different process.

Speculative execution attacks put a dangerous new twist on information leakage through microarchitectural side channels. Ordinarily, programmers can reason about leakage based on the program’s semantics, and prevent said leakage by carefully writing the program to not pass secrets to covert channel-creating “transmitter” instructions, such as branches and loads. Speculative execution breaks this defense because a transmitter might miss-speculatively execute with a secret operand even if it can never execute with said operand invalid executions. There have been much research around the microarchitecture of RISC-V designs to be resistant to Spectre, and the noticeable one being Speculative Privacy Tracking ^[25]^ , hardware protection that delays execution of every transmitter until it can prove that the transmitter’s operands leak during the program’s non-speculative execution. Using a novel dynamic information flow analysis microarchitecture, SPT efficiently proves when such an operand declassification implies that other data becomes declassified, which enables other delayed transmitters to be executed safely.


=== Supply-chain Attack Resistance

Organizations are increasingly at risk of supply chain compromise, whether intentional or unintentional. Managing cyber supply chain risks requires, in part, ensuring the integrity, quality, and resilience of the supply chain, its products, and its services. Cyber supply chain risks may include counterfeiting, unauthorized production, tampering, theft, and insertion of malicious or otherwise unexpected software and hardware, as well as poor manufacturing and development practices in the cyber supply chain.


* Hardware Supply Chain Mitigation:
+
When a design house outsources its hardware design (GDSII format) to contract manufacturing foundry services and assembly services, there could be a potential risk to following threats, which the design house may never come to know.

** IP theft
** Counterfeiting
** Over-production

+
A decade long researched technique - Logic Locki ^ng[1^ 3] has recently matured that helps to lock sensitive IPs or entire SoCs using specific hardware unlocking keys only known to the hardware design house, which can only be used by the design house to unlock it after the part returns from foundry/ assembly thereby eliminating foundry/ assembly services out of trust boundary.


* Software Supply Chain Mitigation:
+
Software supply chain attacks ^[24]^ are an emerging kind of threat that targets software developers and suppliers. The goal is to access source codes, build processes, or update mechanisms by infecting legitimate apps to distribute malware. Because software is built and released by trusted vendors, these apps and updates are signed and certified. In software supply chain attacks, vendors are likely unaware that their apps or updates are infected with malicious code when they’re released to the public. The malicious code then runs with the same trust and permissions as the app. The following types of attacks exist

** Compromised software building tools or updated infrastructure
** Stolen code-sign certificates or signed malicious apps using the stolen identity
** Compromised specialized code shipped into hardware or firmware components
** Pre-installed malware on devices

+
Deploying strong code integrity policies to allow only authorized apps to run on the device and using on-device detection of suspicious activities to take remedial action is a promising way to mitigate against such attacks.
