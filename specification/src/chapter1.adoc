== Introduction

This specification provides normative requirements for building
secure RISC-V systems using RISC-V security building blocks, non-normative 
examples that select a subset of these normative requirements appropriate for a
use case, and non-normative use case specific guidelines. 

It is aimed at developers of RISC-V technical specifications, as well as at 
designers of secure RISC-V systems. It is intended to be referenced by other
documentation that will define a specific subset of requirements applicable 
for a given use case, certification regime, platform or profile.

The non-normative example use cases provided are based on commonly used
security deployment models. These are not intended to be exhaustive but are
common enough to represent a wide range of deployments of secure products. 
They are accompanied by an appropriate set of use case specific security
guidelines which are intended to help readers implement secure products for
their specific use cases.

The set of examples may be extended over time as required.

RISC-V is not intending to create a security certification programme.
This specification is provided as guidance for developing secure
RISC-V systems which are certifiable within existing third party security
certification programmes.

This specification does not define any new RISC-V ISA or non-ISA extensions.
Instead it refers to the existing RISC-V ISA and extensions, as well as commonly
used non-RVI architecture agnostic security features and processes. It aims to show
how those can be combined, in commonly used examples, to create systems which
are certifiabe within commonly used existing security certification programmes.

The examples are not definitions of formal Protection Profiles (See:
https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/protection_profile).
Formal protection profiles are typically provided by third party certification
bodies for different ecosystems. The guidelines provided within the examples in
this specification are intended to help readers adapt RISC-V security features
to meet security requirements of commonly used third party protection profiles.
Mapping documentation or protection profiles may also directly reference this
document.

This specification does not contain threat modelling or security assessment of
the RISC-V ISA specifications, non ISA specifications, profile specifications or 
extensions (RISC-V technical specifications). RISC-V technical specifications
are expected to use the Security Model as a guide to develop their own specific 
security analysis, including formal threat modeling where appropriate. For this 
purpose, all guidelines in this document are labelled to enable referencing from 
other specifications. Specific security analysis in the context of a RISC-V technical 
specification may require testing and a proof of concept as per normal RISC-V 
development processes for RISC-V technical specifications.

Security is an evolving area where new use cases and new threats can emerge at
any time. This specification represents the RISC-V security model and best
practice as of the date of publication of this document.

Terms not explicitely defined in this specification are to be interpreted according
to the NIST Computer Security Resource Centre Glossary (https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary)

New versions of this document may be developed and released as and when
required.

=== Requirements and tracking

This is a normative specification. However, the specification does not mandate
the adoption of any requirements. These requirements are intended to be
referenced by current and future specifications, both RISC-V and external
specifications,  where a subset of the normative requirements, specific to the 
use case, certification regime, platform or profile under consideration will be 
documented. A set of in-scope security threats are also defined in this specification.
These threats are intended to be referenced by the threat models of current and future
specifications, both RISC-V and external specifications. This specification expresses
trackable requirements and threats using the following format:

[width=100%]
[%header, cols="5,20"]
|===
| ID#
| Requirement

| SR_CAT_NNN
| The `SR_CAT` is a "Security Requirement CATegory" prefix that logically groups
the requirements (e.g. SR_UPD denotes security requirements related to updates,
and SR_ATT denotes security requirements related to attestation) and is followed
by 3 digits - `NNN` - assigning a numeric ID to the requirement.

The requirements use the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
"SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" that are to be interpreted as described in
https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt[RFC 2119] when, and only when, they appear
in all capitals, as shown here. When these words are not capitalized, they have
their normal English meanings.

| T_CAT_NNN
| The `T_CAT` is a "Threat CATegory" prefix that logically groups
the threats considered in scope (e.g. T_LGC denotes threats categorised by
logical attacks) and is followed
by 3 digits - `NNN` - assigning a numeric ID to the threat.

|===

A requirement or a group of requirements may be followed by non-normative text
providing context or justification for the requirement. The non-normative text
may also be used to reference sources that are the origin of the requirement.

NOTE: All normative requirements are expressed as mandatory and some sections may
include mutually exclusive requriments. A use case specific requirements document
must define if a requirement is recommended or mandatory, as well as any allowable 
alternatives.  


=== Relationship with external protection profiles

To assist with articulating security guidelines relevant to the included
examples, this specification references external
protection profiles as appropriate. Such references are not intended to mandate
any specific implementations, but to provide guidelines on how RISC-V security
building blocks may be used to comply with those protection profiles.

Typically, protection profiles cover some or all of:

* Security reference architectures and taxonomy
* Hardware and software security requirements
* Interfaces and programming models
* Reference firmware/software
* Certification programs
* Misc Processes and methodology

The following are examples of some external protection profiles that are
referenced by this specification:
